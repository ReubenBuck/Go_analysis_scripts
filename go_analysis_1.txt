Gene Ontology AnalysisWe are looking at over represented terms of genes in certain regions.Identify the roles that genes in the H region are involved in. At the same time we donâ€™t know where the h region truly is. Approach 1:Look at enrichment levels of terms at various cutoffs, and watch the dynamicsApproach 2: Genes located near ancestral elements, wheather or not they fit into functional catagories, and also which bins they are found in.Approach 3: Use approach one but break thigs down into coexpression modukes.Once we have modules that belong in the H region. We can then ask what processes they are involved in. Approach 4:Changing the bin size. This dramaticly increases the sample space we are looking within, not only do we have to copy with decreasing H threshod, but we have to do so at different bin sizes.With each approach its important to realise the drawbacks and assumptions. Especially in the confines of the questiuon. # also need to control for multiple testing.
